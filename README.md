# Flights-Database-Visualisation
We will consider the flights.db database which contains data from: https://openflights.org/data.html 

This contains three tables which represent airports, airlines and airlines. 

The purpose of the project is to visualize a certain amount of information contained in the database. 

To make this all work, we'll use: the flights.db database a basemap like this one: https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fichier:Equirectangular-projection-topographic-world.jpg

Exercice 1 :

List the 15 cities with the most airports in the database to obtain the result sorted in descending order.

Exercice 2 :

Construct and display the number of airlines per country. 

Draw points on the map proportional to the number of airlines per country. 

We can use the coord_country dataframe defined in the file provided.
